# E-Commerce System Project

## Overview

This E-Commerce system was developed as the final project for my programming course at university. The project is built using Java and features a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Java Swing. It demonstrates the application of various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including encapsulation, data hiding, and inheritance. The system provides functionalities typical of an online shopping platform, and incorporates robust input validation to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Add, update, and remove products.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add and remove items anytime you want.
- **Order confirmation**: confirm the order, and an invoice will be printed with your products and the total price.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures accurate and secure data entry with extensive validation mechanisms.

## OOP Concepts Implemented

- **Encapsulation & Data Hiding**: Protects data and accesses it through public methods.
- **Inheritance**: Shares common functionality across different classes through inheritance.

## Time Frame

- we started this project on the 9nd of April 2024 and I managed to finish the project on the 29th of April 2024 before the deadline which was on the 6th of May 2024.
