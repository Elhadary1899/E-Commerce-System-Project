# E-Commerce-System-Project
This E-Commerce system was developed as the final project for my programming II course at university. The project is built using Java and features a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Java Swing. It demonstrates the application of various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including encapsulation, data hiding, and inheritance.
